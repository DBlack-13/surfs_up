### Overview of the Statistical Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to help W. Avy determine which locations set up his new surf and icecream shops throughout Hawaii. W. Avy has learned in the past that temperature and weather has a big factor on wether the shops will be succesful or not, so he wanted us run an analysis if certain locations would meet his requirements before he considers investing in it. 

### Results
There are 3 major points to notate when comparing the temperature in June and December.
- When looking at the average temperatures in June and December you notice that there is hardly a difference. June's average temperature is 75 degrees where Decemeber's average temperature is 71 degrees. This shows us that summer and winter tempatures hardly change, meaning that icecream and surfing would still be ideal year round.
